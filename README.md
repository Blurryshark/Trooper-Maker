# Trooper-Maker

This assignment was both an exercise in inheritance and a challenge to be able to write a given program within certain time constraints in preparation for a midterm exam. 

There are two branches. Main contains the initial project, which took me around 6 hours to complete the first time. The 'exam-review' branch was my second attempt at the assignment, which I was able to complete in 2 hours.
